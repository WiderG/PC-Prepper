# PC-Prepper - A shitty BatchScript™️ by Wider®️

Ever booted up a new PC and thought "Fuck sake, I need to do that whole rigmaroll with ninite / downloading the programs manually (if you're a virgin)"?
Think no longer! Wider presents a new batch file that can prepare a PC faster than you can cook a rustlers burger in a microwave.
This program does the following:

# Installs:

* Python 3.9.7
* Chrome
* VLC
* Discord
* Steam
* Shutter Encoder
* 7zip
* Java
* Paint.net

Oh, it also enables dark mode. 
That's about all it does.  Thank you and goodbye.
